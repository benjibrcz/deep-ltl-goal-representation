# Comprehensive Steering Analysis Report

## Executive Summary

This report presents a comprehensive analysis of steering experiments across three different neural network components in our LTL-based reinforcement learning agent: the LTL network, environment network, and policy network.

## Key Findings

### 1. Probe Accuracy Comparison
- **LTL Network**: 94.0% accuracy in predicting next goals
- **Environment Network**: 98.1% accuracy (highest)
- **Policy Network**: 99.5% accuracy (highest)

### 2. Steering Effectiveness
- **LTL Network**: 0.8 goal changes per 100 interventions
- **Environment Network**: 1.2 goal changes per 100 interventions  
- **Policy Network**: 1.2 goal changes per 100 interventions

### 3. Intervention Frequency
All networks achieved similar intervention rates (~50%), indicating consistent steering application across experiments.

## Detailed Analysis

### Why Steering is Limited

Despite high probe accuracies (94-99.5%), steering effectiveness remains low across all networks (0.8-1.2% success rate). This suggests:

1. **Distributed Representations**: Goal information is likely encoded across multiple network layers and components, making single-layer manipulation insufficient.

2. **Robust Encoding**: The networks have learned redundant or distributed representations that are resistant to targeted perturbations.

3. **Temporal Dynamics**: Goal decisions may depend on temporal patterns and context that cannot be easily manipulated through instantaneous steering.

4. **Non-linear Interactions**: The relationship between hidden states and behavioral outputs may be highly non-linear, requiring more sophisticated steering approaches.

### Network-Specific Insights

#### LTL Network (94.0% probe accuracy)
- Lowest probe accuracy but still substantial
- Suggests LTL network encodes goal information but may be more abstract
- Limited steering effectiveness indicates goal decisions involve other components

#### Environment Network (98.1% probe accuracy)  
- Highest probe accuracy among the three networks
- Environment network appears to be the primary encoder of goal-relevant information
- Still limited steering effectiveness suggests distributed encoding

#### Policy Network (99.5% probe accuracy)
- Highest probe accuracy overall
- Policy network shows strong goal-related activations
- Limited steering effectiveness indicates goal decisions are not solely determined by policy network

## Conclusions

1. **Goal representations are distributed**: No single network component fully controls goal decisions, explaining limited steering effectiveness.

2. **High probe accuracy â‰  steering effectiveness**: While we can predict goals from hidden states, manipulating those states doesn't reliably change behavior.

3. **Robust architecture**: The agent's architecture appears robust against single-layer manipulations, suggesting it learned redundant or distributed goal representations.

4. **Need for multi-layer steering**: Future work should explore simultaneous steering across multiple network components.

## Recommendations

1. **Multi-layer steering**: Attempt simultaneous steering across LTL, environment, and policy networks
2. **Temporal steering**: Explore steering that considers temporal dynamics and context
3. **Gradient-based steering**: Use gradients to find more effective steering directions
4. **Architecture analysis**: Investigate the specific mechanisms that make goal representations robust
