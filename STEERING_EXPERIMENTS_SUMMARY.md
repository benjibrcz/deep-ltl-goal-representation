# Steering Experiments Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the comprehensive steering analysis experiments conducted on the DeepLTL agent. We explored how goal information is encoded across different neural network components and attempted to manipulate agent behavior through representation steering.

## Experiments Conducted

### 1. Goal Probing Analysis
**Script**: `src/probe_goal.py`  
**Run Script**: `run_probe_goal.py`  
**Report**: `PROBE_GOAL_REPORT.md`

**Results**:
- Successfully probed LTL network RNN hidden states
- Achieved 94.0% accuracy in predicting next goals
- Collected 1000 valid labels (614 blue, 386 green)
- Demonstrated that LTL network encodes goal information

### 2. LTL Network Steering
**Script**: `src/steer_goals.py`  
**Run Script**: `run_steer_goals.py`  
**Report**: `STEERING_EXPERIMENT_REPORT.md`

**Results**:
- 247 steering interventions (49.4% rate)
- Only 2 goal changes observed
- 0.8% steering effectiveness
- Limited behavioral impact despite high probe accuracy

### 3. Multi-Layer Probing
**Script**: `src/probe_policy.py`  
**Run Script**: `run_probe_policy.py`  
**Report**: `MULTI_LAYER_PROBING_REPORT.md`

**Results**:
- Environment network: 98.1% probe accuracy (highest)
- LTL network: 94.0% probe accuracy
- Policy network: Failed to collect features (hook registration issue)
- Environment network appears to be primary goal encoder

### 4. Environment Network Steering
**Script**: `src/steer_env_network.py`  
**Run Script**: `run_env_steering.py`  
**Report**: `STEERING_EXPERIMENT_REPORT.md`

**Results**:
- 248 steering interventions (49.6% rate)
- 3 goal changes observed
- 1.2% steering effectiveness
- Slightly better than LTL network but still limited

### 5. Policy Network Steering
**Script**: `src/steer_policy_network.py`  
**Run Script**: `run_policy_steering.py`  
**Report**: `COMPREHENSIVE_STEERING_REPORT.md`

**Results**:
- Successfully hooked into policy network layers
- 99.5% probe accuracy (highest overall)
- 252 steering interventions (50.4% rate)
- 3 goal changes observed
- 1.2% steering effectiveness

### 6. Comprehensive Analysis
**Script**: `src/comprehensive_steering_analysis.py`  
**Run Script**: `run_comprehensive_analysis.py`  
**Report**: `COMPREHENSIVE_STEERING_REPORT.md`

**Results**:
- Generated comprehensive comparison charts
- Analyzed steering effectiveness patterns
- Created final synthesis report

## Key Findings

### 1. Probe Accuracy Rankings
1. **Policy Network**: 99.5% accuracy
2. **Environment Network**: 98.1% accuracy  
3. **LTL Network**: 94.0% accuracy

### 2. Steering Effectiveness Rankings
1. **Environment Network**: 1.2% success rate
2. **Policy Network**: 1.2% success rate
3. **LTL Network**: 0.8% success rate

### 3. Critical Insight
**High probe accuracy does not guarantee steering effectiveness**. Despite being able to predict goals with 94-99.5% accuracy from hidden states, manipulating those states only changes behavior 0.8-1.2% of the time.

## Technical Achievements

1. **Successfully hooked into all three network components** (LTL, environment, policy)
2. **Trained effective linear probes** with 94-99.5% accuracy
3. **Implemented steering mechanisms** for all network types
4. **Collected comprehensive behavioral data** across 500+ step rollouts
5. **Generated detailed visualizations** and analysis reports
6. **Identified distributed goal representations** as key insight

## Conclusions

The experiments reveal that goal information is **distributed across multiple network components** rather than localized to any single layer. While we can predict goals with high accuracy from hidden states, the agent's architecture is **robust against single-layer manipulations**, suggesting it learned redundant or distributed goal representations.

This finding has important implications for:
- **Interpretability**: Goal decisions involve complex interactions across multiple components
- **Robustness**: The agent's architecture resists simple adversarial manipulations
- **Future steering approaches**: Multi-layer simultaneous steering may be more effective

## Next Steps

1. **Multi-layer steering**: Attempt simultaneous steering across all three networks
2. **Temporal steering**: Explore steering that considers temporal dynamics
3. **Gradient-based steering**: Use gradients to find more effective steering directions
4. **Architecture analysis**: Investigate specific mechanisms that make representations robust
