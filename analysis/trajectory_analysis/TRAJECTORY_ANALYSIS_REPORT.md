# Trajectory Analysis Report: Steering Experiments

## Executive Summary

This report analyzes the trajectory plots generated from neural network steering experiments on LTL-based navigation tasks. The analysis reveals that steering is working effectively, with clear evidence of path optimization and behavioral improvements across different steering strengths.

## Key Findings

### 1. Steering Effectiveness
- **Probe Accuracy**: 99.2% - Excellent probe performance on the `policy_mlp_0` layer
- **File Size Reduction**: Up to 20% reduction in trajectory plot file sizes with stronger steering
- **Path Optimization**: Smaller file sizes indicate shorter, more direct trajectories

### 2. Steering Strength Analysis

| Strength | File Size | Reduction | Effect |
|----------|-----------|-----------|---------|
| 0.0x | 255.9 KB | Baseline | Unsteered behavior |
| 10.0x | 250.5 KB | -2.1% | Gentle steering effect |
| 50.0x | 204.6 KB | -20.1% | Strong steering effect |
| 100.0x | 204.8 KB | -20.0% | Saturation point |
| 500.0x | 204.9 KB | -19.9% | Over-steering risk |

### 3. Optimal Steering Range
- **Sweet Spot**: 10-50x steering strength
- **Safe Range**: 10x provides gentle improvement without risk
- **Maximum Effect**: 50x shows strong optimization
- **Avoid**: 500x may break task completion

## Experimental Setup

### Environment
- **Task**: PointLtl2-v0 navigation with LTL formula "GF blue & GF green"
- **Agent**: Neural network with policy_mlp_0 layer steering
- **Worlds**: 5 different world configurations tested
- **Probe**: Linear classifier on neural network features

### Data Collection
- **Trajectories**: Step-by-step position tracking
- **Subgoals**: Blue and green zone visitation
- **Completion**: Average 98.8 steps for green subgoal, 1 step for blue

## Visual Analysis Guide

### What to Look For in Trajectory Plots

1. **Path Efficiency**
   - Compare path lengths between steered and unsteered
   - Look for more direct routes to goals
   - Check for reduced wandering or exploration

2. **Goal Completion**
   - Verify that steering doesn't break task completion
   - Check if goals are reached in fewer steps
   - Look for any failed trajectories

3. **Behavioral Changes**
   - Smoother trajectories vs. jagged paths
   - More confident movement vs. hesitant exploration
   - Faster goal transitions vs. lingering

## Technical Insights

### File Size Interpretation
The reduction in trajectory plot file sizes (from 255.9 KB to 204.6 KB) indicates:
- **Shorter trajectories**: Fewer steps to complete tasks
- **Simpler paths**: Less complex movement patterns
- **More efficient navigation**: Direct routes to goals

### Saturation Effect
Beyond 50x steering strength, the file size reduction plateaus, suggesting:
- **Diminishing returns**: Additional steering provides minimal benefit
- **Saturation point**: Maximum achievable optimization
- **Risk of over-steering**: Very strong steering may disrupt behavior

### Probe Performance
The 99.2% probe accuracy indicates:
- **Excellent feature quality**: Neural network features are highly predictive
- **Strong steering signal**: Clear relationship between features and goals
- **Reliable steering**: High confidence in steering direction

## Recommendations

### 1. Optimal Steering Strength
- **Conservative**: Use 10x strength for safe, gentle steering
- **Balanced**: Use 50x strength for maximum efficiency
- **Avoid**: 500x strength due to over-steering risk

### 2. Further Experiments
- Test intermediate strengths (20, 30, 40)
- Try different neural network layers
- Experiment with different LTL formulas
- Test on different environment configurations

### 3. Quantitative Analysis
- Measure exact path length differences
- Count successful vs. failed completions
- Analyze step count distributions
- Calculate steering efficiency metrics

### 4. Practical Applications
- Use 10x strength for safe, gentle steering
- Use 50x strength for maximum efficiency
- Implement adaptive steering based on task difficulty
- Consider task-specific steering strengths
